# Job-App-Tracker

# Are you a freshly baked college graduate or a burnt out career professional out on display wafting your resume to every passing company hoping one of them will buy?
(Why the bread/baking puns? To prove I'm not AI.) 

# Recently, currently, I embarked on the journey as a career changing professional and, it is TOUGH out there.

# Keeping track of the increasingly insane number of applications manually was just too much but it gave me the brilliant idea, I can create a program for that especially being a SOftware Developer and all.

# That ladies and bears is the beginning of this program, which for now I will keep simple and over time expand. 

# Maybe there are already similar programs that does such thing, but I didn't check since this is also for the practice as much as the practicality. 

# If you would like to make contribution, check out (and including the not yet existing) rules.

# The idea for now: 
  # Manually* enter relevant information into schema, which will be stored in a database
  # *Evantually, a microservice should scrape the webpage for relevant information for the database
  # Information from the database can then be used to propegate varying templates 
  # Add micro-services that uses these information to generate varying stats
